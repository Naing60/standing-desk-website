            <p><span>Standing desks</span> can improve health by reducing the risks associated with prolonged sitting, such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. They also boost mental well-being and work satisfaction.</p>

                    <p class="description-health">Nearly everybody knows that you gain weight by consuming more calories than you can burn. Contrarily, you can also lose weight whenever you burn more calories than you consume. If you work while standing instead of sitting, you can reduce the risk of weight gain and obesity by burning some extra calories each hour you work. <br> <br> Those calories you burn can pile up over time, and if you were to do so over an entire year, the amount of burnt calories becomes quite notable. If you want to enhance this physical standing desk advantage, you can incorporate some standing desk exercises while working. For example, if you march in place, you can burn up to 225 calories per hour while stimulating your brain activity, making you more productive and energetic.</p>

                    <audio controls src="audio/May_Lower_Your_Blood_Sugar_Levels.mp3"></audio>
                    <p class="description-health">
                        Lowering your blood sugar levels is another health benefit of a standing desk. Whenever you have a meal, your blood sugar can increase quite a bit. The more it does, the worse it can be for your health. People that have insulin resistance or diabetes are even more at risk.
                        <br><br>
                        Fortunately, a standing-based office work study showed that you could significantly reduce the sugar spike after lunch by 43% by standing for three hours after the meal. This is in comparison to people who were sitting for the same amount of time. Switching between sitting and standing throughout the workday on a 30-minute interval after lunch break also reduces the blood sugar spike by 11% on average.
                        <br><br>
                        There may even be a link between these effects and how excessive sedentary time links to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. If you want to be on the safe side, get a standing desk and implement a sit-stand routine, especially after meals.</p>

                    <audio controls src="audio/Reduces_Neck_and_Back_Pain.mp3"></audio>
                    <p class="description-health">If you are someone who sits all day, I'm sure you've experienced some type of back and/or neck pain. Sitting all day can cause a lot of stress on your spine and may even lead to disc damage. When staring at a monitor for a long period of time, you start to exhibit bad posture by arching our backs. If your monitor isn't at the correct ergonomic position, causing you to tilt your head down, you can get neck strain.
                        <br><br>
                        Preventing Chronic Disease, the Take-a-Stand Project, studied a group of individuals who tried sitting, standing, or walking over the course of one week, two weeks, and four weeks. Over the progression of time, the group claimed they had less lower back pain and shoulder tension, improved posture, and overall increased mood and comfort. If you are looking to reduce your neck or back pain, a standing desk could be the perfect solution.</p>

                    <p class="description-health">When you are standing, your brain becomes more engaged which can increase your energy. Standing helps your blood flow easily which sends more oxygen to your muscles. When you sit for long periods of time, you tend to feel tired. Standing is a great way to boost your mood and energy, which can help prevent fatigue. With all of this increased energy, you are able to stay focused on tasks and be more productive.</p>

                    <audio controls src="audio/Reduce_Health_Risks.mp3"></audio>
                    <p class="description-health">The notion that standing is better than sitting is something that's been studied for a long time now. In particular, a study in 1953 found that bus conductors who sit throughout the day had twice the chance of dying from heart diseases than coworkers who had been standing during the whole day.
                        <br><br>
                        Since then, it has been a matter of constant study, but now there is a greater understanding of the matter. Frequently sitting for an extended time can significantly increase the risk of heart disease. If you spend your entire day sitting, even an hour of intense exercise may not compensate for the negative effect it has.
                        <br><br>
                        There isn't any doubt that spending more time standing is beneficial for you. The physical standing desk health benefit, in this case, is tremendous.</p>
